## Estimate the deformation velocity map on Fernandina volcano, Galapagos      

Goal: estimate a 2D linear velocity filed in space from a 3D time-series dataset (2D in space, 1D in time)

1. read dataset from file timeseries.h5
2. build functional model and design matrix
3. convert design matrix into doe
4. esitmate velocity and plot it.
